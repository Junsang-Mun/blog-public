## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Junsang-Mun/blog-public.git
cd blog-public
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `sample.github.env`. Ensure all keys and values are correctly set up. These include:

- **GitHub OAuth Credentials**:
  - `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
  - `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `VITE_REDIRECT_URI`
- **Admin Email**:
  - `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`

For GitHub Actions, add these variables under **Secrets and Variables** in your GitHub repository settings.

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Admin Console

The admin console is located at:

```
YOUR_URL/console
```

### Login Page

To access the admin console, visit:

```
YOUR_URL/login
```

Use your GitHub account to log in. Ensure the email associated with your GitHub account matches the `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL` specified in the environment variables.

## üì¶ Deployment

This project is configured to be deployed to a **Virtual Machine (VM)** using **GitHub Actions**. The deployment process is automated and ensures that the application is built, tested, and deployed seamlessly to the target server.

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow is defined in the file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. It is triggered automatically on:

1. **Push to the `main` branch**: Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will trigger the deployment process.
2. **Manual Trigger**: You can manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions interface using the `workflow_dispatch` event.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure the following are set up:

1. **Secrets Configuration**:
   - Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**:
     - `ENV_VITE_REDIRECT_URI`: The redirect URI for GitHub OAuth.
     - `ENV_VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: The GitHub OAuth client secret.
     - `ENV_VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: The GitHub OAuth client ID.
     - `ENV_VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The admin email for authentication.
     - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private SSH key for accessing the target VM.
     - `SSH_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the target VM.
     - `SSH_USERNAME`: The username for SSH access to the VM.

2. **Target VM Setup**:
   - Ensure the VM has the following installed:
     - **Node.js** (version 22 or compatible with the app).
     - **PM2** for process management.
     - **SQLite** for the database.
   - The VM should allow SSH access using the private key provided in the GitHub secrets.

3. **Database Backup Directory**:
   - The workflow creates a `~/backups` directory on the VM to store database backups before deployment. Ensure sufficient storage is available.

### Deployment Steps

The deployment process includes the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code**: The workflow checks out the latest code from the `main` branch.
2. **Set Up Node.js**: Installs the specified Node.js version and caches dependencies.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Installs all required dependencies using `npm ci`.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Creates a `.env.production` file on the VM with the required environment variables.
5. **Build Application**: Builds the SvelteKit application for production.
6. **Generate Prisma Client**: Ensures the Prisma client is generated for database interactions.
7. **SSH Setup**: Configures SSH access to the target VM using the private key.
8. **Backup Database**: Creates a backup of the existing SQLite database (if it exists) in the `~/backups` directory.
9. **Deploy Files**: Uses `rsync` to transfer the application files to the VM, excluding unnecessary files like `.git`, `node_modules`, and the database file.
10. **Post-Deployment Commands**:
    - Ensures the SQLite database file exists.
    - Installs production dependencies.
    - Runs Prisma migrations to update the database schema.
    - Restarts the application using **PM2**.

### Manual Deployment

If you need to manually trigger the deployment workflow:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the **Deploy to VM** workflow.
3. Click the **Run workflow** button and confirm.

### Monitoring the Deployment

You can monitor the deployment process in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository. Each step in the workflow logs its progress, making it easy to debug any issues.

### Post-Deployment

After deployment, the application will be running on the target VM. You can verify the deployment by visiting the application URL.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Developers

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all environment variables are correctly configured before running the app.
2. **Admin Authentication**: Only authorized users can access the admin console. Unauthorized access attempts will be logged.
3. **Database**: The project uses SQLite by default. For production, consider switching to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
4. **Logs**: Visitor logs are stored in the database. Regularly clear old logs to maintain performance.

Happy coding! üéâ
